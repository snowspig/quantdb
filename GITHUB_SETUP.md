# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Preparing for GitHub Deployment

The repository is now ready to be pushed to GitHub. Follow these steps to complete the deployment:

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the '+' icon in the top-right corner and select 'New repository'
3. Name your repository (suggested: 'quantdb')
4. Add a description: "A comprehensive data platform for quantitative finance research and analysis"
5. Choose visibility (public or private)
6. Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license as we already have these files
7. Click 'Create repository'

### 2. Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands in your local terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quantdb.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

Replace 'YOUR_USERNAME' with your actual GitHub username.

### 3. Verify Security Concerns

- The config/config.yaml file with sensitive information has been excluded using .gitignore
- Only the config.yaml.sample file will be pushed to GitHub
- Users will need to create their own config.yaml file from the sample

### 4. Repository Structure

The repository has a well-organized structure with:
- Comprehensive documentation in the README.md and docs/ directory
- Sample configuration file without sensitive information
- Proper licensing (MIT License)
- All required implementation files for the QuantDB platform

### 5. After Deployment

- Set up GitHub issues for tracking feature requests and bug reports
- Consider setting up GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Document any additional setup steps in the wiki if needed

### Security Note

Never push sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or connection strings to public repositories. Always use environment variables or configuration files that are excluded from version control for such data.
